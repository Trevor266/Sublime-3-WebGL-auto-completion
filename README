This is simply an unfinished auto-completion file for sublime that offers notes about the various components 
of WebGL, taken straight from the documentation. The file is simple and to extend it all you need 
to do is copy and paste the trigger and contents portion at the bottom for each new completion you would like 
to add and write out what you want in each one, trigger is going to be the tooltip that gets displayed
as you hover over the completion, and contents is what hitting tab will actually auto-complete to.
